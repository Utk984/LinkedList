Here is a README for a repository of DSA linked list solutions in C++:

# DSA Linked List Solutions in C++ 

This repository contains solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems using linked lists in C++.

## Overview

Linked lists are fundamental data structures that organize data with nonlinear structure. Each element points to the next. 

This repo focuses on solving linked list problems related to but not limited to:

- Insertion and Deletion 
- Reversal
- Searching 
- Sorting
- Detecting Cycles

## Solutions

Each file contains a linked list based solution to a specific problem. The problems were sourced from GeeksforGeeks [Linked List Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) article and practice problems.

## Running the Solutions

The solutions are compiled and run as standalone C++ files. For example:

```
g++ solutions/reverse_linkedlist.cpp
./a.out
```

Each file has a `main()` function to demonstrate the solution.
